Manage your expenses using your Android smartphone. Keep track of your expenses as you go.

Who doesn’t have a goal for the new year that involves money? Many of us have goals that involve making more money or managing the money we already have — but, no matter exactly what goal you might have for your money, you’ll probably need some baseline information about it.

Tracking expenses can be a relatively simple matter and can provide you so much information about your spending habits.
